This lesson will introduce the CMS trigger system and how luminosity is calculated. As we work toward a search for $Z'$ bosons, we will discuss how to choose analysis trigger paths, the implications that has for other analysis choices, and how use the `brilcalc` tool to evaluate the luminosity collected by different triggers.
